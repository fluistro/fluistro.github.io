			<h1>Instructions</h1>
			<p>
			You play as Joseph, a wizard and beloved hat shop owner. <br>
			Use the arrow keys to move and get through all of the floors of the tower and retrieve your stolen hats.<br>
			If you run into Donald's minions or they run into you, you die and must restart from the beginning.<br>
			There are three types of magical hats scattered throughout the tower :<br>
			The yellow jump hat allows Joseph to jump over spikes.<br>
			The blue water hat allows Joseph to put out flames.<br>
			The red strength hat allows Joseph to move around boulders.<br><br>
			Beware: once you take a hat, it's gone. <br>
			In order to proceed to the next floor you must reach the staircase.<br>
			Good Luck!<br>

			<p>In the town of Hatville, there lives a wizard named Joseph. Joseph is a local hat seller that sells his magical hats
			to the people for them to use in their everyday lives. Despite being a small business, his shop vastly outperforms the 
			incredibly large hat company owned by the wizard Donald. Donald's hat company has stores all across the realm, but its
			headquarters, also known as the Donald Hat Co. tower, are right in the heart of Hatville, where Joseph's store thrives. 
			For years, Donald tried to compete with Joseph's popularity, but his efforts were to no avail. He has become so jealous that last night, 
			he sent his minions to rob Joseph's entire stock, bring the stolen hats to him, and set up obstacles to defend those hats. 
			However, Donalds minions, being the unintelligent creatures they are, left a trail of hats leading to the headquarters and 
			even left some of the hats spread across the headquarter's floors. When Joseph awoke this morning to the sight of his ravaged store and the trail of hats, 
			he followed the trail until he reached the Donald Hat Co. tower. Now knowing who the thief is, Joseph has made it his goal to take back his hats.</p>
